# Twilight Princess Remastered

## What is this?

This is a community-driven project aiming to enhance and remaster *The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess*. The project focuses on improving visuals, audio, and gameplay, while staying true to the original experience.

Remastering involves modifying and enhancing assets, textures, and mechanics to modernize the game and provide an improved player experience.

## Project goals

The long-term goal of this project is to create a highly polished remastered version of Twilight Princess. This includes:

- High-definition textures and models
- Improved lighting and shading
- Enhanced audio quality and sound effects
- Gameplay tweaks for smoother mechanics
- Improved modding tools to allow further customization

We aim to remaster the **GameCube USA** version first, as it is the foundation of the Twilight Princess experience. Future goals include compatibility with other versions of the game, such as:

- PAL GameCube
- JPN GameCube
- Wii versions (USA, PAL, JPN, KOR)
- Nvidia Shield versions
