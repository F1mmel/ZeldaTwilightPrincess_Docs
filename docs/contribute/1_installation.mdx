  **Open the Tool:**  
   Put the GameCube iso file into the "iso/" folder and launch the executable.
  
  **Apply Modifications:**  
   Follow the on-screen instructions to:  
    - Optimize the game's performance for modern systems.  
    - Enable additional graphical enhancements and fixes.  
    - Apply patches for compatibility with the remastered engine.

 **Verify Integrity:**  
   The tool will perform a final check to ensure all required changes were applied successfully.  

:::note Important  
The Configurator will not need delete or overwrite the iso file!
