We are excited to welcome contributors! If you're interested in helping bring this fan project to life, read on to find out how you can get involved. If you have any further questions, feel free to connect with us on our [community Discord server](https://discord.gg/WK8umpGm)!  

## How can you contribute?  

To participate in this project, you'll need the following:  
- A legally obtained copy of the GameCube USA version of *The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess*.  
- [Unity Hub](https://unity.com/) and the latest Unity Editor (LTS version recommended).  
- A basic understanding of Git for version control.  
- Familiarity with programming concepts (Unity development experience and C# knowledge are a bonus).  

No advanced programming skills are required—this is a collaborative effort where you’ll gain experience as you contribute to various aspects of the project.  

While previous experience in game design or asset creation is helpful, it’s not a requirement. We’ll provide guidelines and resources to help you get started.  

A reasonably powerful computer with good GPU capabilities is recommended to ensure smooth performance during development.  

:::note Important reminder  
You must **own a legitimate copy of the original game** to participate. Please note that we cannot assist you in obtaining it.

:::tip For Windows users  
Our project is cross-platform, but most of the documentation and tools are optimized for Windows users, with additional support for macOS and Linux. We recommend installing Unity on your preferred operating system to streamline your workflow.
