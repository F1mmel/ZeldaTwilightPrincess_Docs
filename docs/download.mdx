### 2. Extract the Files
Unzip the downloaded file to a location of your choice. Inside the extracted folder, locate the directory named `iso/`.

### 3. Prepare Your ISO
Place your GameCube Twilight Princess ISO file into the `iso/` folder.

### 4. Launch the Configurator
Run the `ZeldaTPConfigurator.exe` tool located in the extracted directory. Follow the on-screen instructions to:

- Apply necessary patches and modifications to your ISO.
- Enable performance optimizations and graphical improvements.
- Verify that the ISO is ready for use with the remastered project.
